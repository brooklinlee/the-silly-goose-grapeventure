/* 
Cached element references of each 'page' in HTML
Create an array of the locations of each 'page' (div) in HTML

Give each page a class of either 'active' or 'hidden'. Hidden classes will be given a CSS property of .hidden{display:none;}.

Use event listeners on each button where 'click' has a function associated with it that will change the class of the targeted div from hidden to active or vice versa as necessary

define a function for each page movement that will change all of the pages elements to hidden, then change the targeted page's class to active

define an init() function that will at page initialization make sure that only page one's class is active and the rest are set to hidden

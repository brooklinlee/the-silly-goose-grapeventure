# The Silly Goose Grape-Venture

![image of first page of game](./assets/Images/game-screenshot.png)

The Silly Goose Grape-Venture is a Choose Your Own Adventure game based on the once viral "Duck Song" that took the early internet by storm in 2009. In this game you will play a silly goose who is searchingn for something to do and hopefully some grapes to eat on a warm sunny day. After starting the game, you will be moved through several screens with two different choices at the bottom. Some choices will move you forward to the next choice, while others will result in a game over. As a callback to the original internet song this game is based off of, there is no true way to win this game and you can get stuck in an endless loop looking for grapes.

 - [ ] Update design to be more repsonsive and look good on multiple sizes of screens
 - [ ] Add more animations to make the story feel more "alive"
